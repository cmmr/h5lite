\title{Get R Class of an HDF5 Object or Attribute}
\usage{
h5_class(file, name, attr = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The path to the HDF5 file.}

\item{name}{The full path of the object (group or dataset) to check.}

\item{attr}{The name of an attribute to check. If \code{NULL} (default), the function
checks the class of the object itself.}
}
\value{
A character string representing the R class (e.g., \code{"numeric"}, \code{"complex"},
\code{"character"}, \code{"factor"}, \code{"raw"}, \code{"list"}, \code{"NULL"}).
Returns \code{NA_character_} for HDF5 types that \code{h5lite} cannot read.
}
\description{
Inspects an HDF5 object (or an attribute attached to it) and returns the R class
that \code{h5_read()} would produce.
}
\details{
This function determines the resulting R class by inspecting the storage metadata.

\itemize{
\item \strong{Groups} are reported as \code{"list"}.
\item \strong{Integer/Float} datasets/attributes are reported as \code{"numeric"}.
\item \strong{String} datasets/attributes are reported as \code{"character"}.
\item \strong{Complex} datasets/attributes are reported as \code{"complex"}.
\item \strong{Enum} datasets/attributes are reported as \code{"factor"}.
\item \strong{1-byte Opaque} datasets/attributes are reported as \code{"raw"}.
\item \strong{Compound} datasets/attributes are reported as \code{"data.frame"}.
\item \strong{Null} datasets/attributes (with a null dataspace) are reported as \code{"NULL"}.
}

file <- tempfile(fileext = ".h5")
