\title{Write a List Recursively to HDF5}
\usage{
h5_write_all(file, name, data, compress = TRUE, attrs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to the HDF5 file.}

\item{name}{The name of the top-level group to write the list into.}

\item{data}{The nested R \code{list} to write.}

\item{compress}{A logical or an integer from 0-9. This compression setting is
applied to all datasets written during the recursive operation.}

\item{attrs}{Controls which R attributes are written for the \strong{datasets} within
the list. See \code{\link[=h5_write]{h5_write()}} for details. This does not affect attributes on
the lists/groups themselves, which are always written.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}.

\description{
Writes a nested R list to an HDF5 file, creating a corresponding group
and dataset structure.
}
\details{
This function provides a way to save a complex, nested R list as an HDF5
hierarchy.
\itemize{
\item R \code{list} objects are created as HDF5 groups.
\item All other supported R objects (vectors, matrices, arrays, factors) are
written as HDF5 datasets.
\item Attributes of a list are written as HDF5 attributes on the corresponding group.
\item The \code{attrs} argument controls how attributes of the datasets (non-list elements)
are handled.
}

Before writing any data, \code{h5_write_all} performs a "dry run" to validate
that all objects and attributes within the list are of a writeable type. If
any part of the structure is invalid, the function will throw an error and
no data will be written to the file.

\examples{
file <- tempfile(fileext = ".h5")

# Create a nested list with attributes
my_list <- list(
  config = list(version = 1.2, user = "test"),
  data = list(
    matrix = matrix(1:4, 2),
    vector = 1:10
  )
)
attr(my_list$data, "info") <- "This is the data group"

h5_write_all(file, "session_data", my_list)

h5_ls(file, recursive = TRUE)

unlink(file)
