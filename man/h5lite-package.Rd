\title{h5lite: A Simple and Lightweight HDF5 Interface}
\description{
The h5lite package provides a simple, lightweight, and user-friendly
interface for reading and writing HDF5 files. It is designed for R users
who want to save and load R objects (vectors, matrices, arrays) to an
HDF5 file without needing to understand the low-level details of the HDF5 C API.
}
\details{
\code{h5lite} handles common tasks automatically:
\itemize{
\item Saving R objects with the correct dimensions.
\item Reading data back into R as matrices or arrays.
\item Reading and writing R \code{factor} objects as native HDF5 \code{ENUM} types.
\item Automatically overwriting data and creating parent groups.
\item Writing compressed datasets.
\item Safely reading all numeric types without integer overflow.
\item Reading and writing R \code{raw} vectors.
}

This package uses the HDF5 library developed by The HDF Group
(\url{https://www.hdfgroup.org/}).
