\title{Read a Dataset from HDF5}
\usage{
h5_read(file, name)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to the HDF5 file.}

\item{name}{Name of the dataset (e.g., "/data/matrix").}
}
\value{
A \code{numeric}, \code{character}, or \code{raw} vector/array.
}
\description{
Reads a dataset from an HDF5 file and returns it as an R object.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Numeric datasets are read as \code{numeric} (double) to prevent overflow.
\item String datasets are read as \code{character}.
\item 1-byte \code{OPAQUE} datasets are read as \code{raw}.
}

Dimensions are preserved and transposed to match R's column-major order.

\examples{
file <- tempfile(fileext = ".h5")

# Write a matrix
mat <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
h5_write(file, "example_matrix", mat)

# Read it back
mat2 <- h5_read(file, "example_matrix")
print(mat2)

# Verify equality
all.equal(mat, mat2)
